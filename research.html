          Economic Insecurity and Gender in Politics: How Perceptions of
          Economic Insecurity shape Womenâ€™s Electoral Prospects
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> -</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jhinuk Banerjee</p>
        <p>This article examines the influence of perceptions of economic insecurity 
          on voters' decisions to vote for women candidates for political seats and 
          on women's willingness to participate in politics. The study considers various aspects of economic insecurity 
          like female-to-male employment ratio, unemployment rates, and gender inequality 
          in education attainment, wage volatility, and displacement rates, among others. It has been 
          found that economic uncertainty has different effects on female candidate voters 
          choice. Left-wing parties always comprise a higher percentage of women than right-wing parties, 
          indicating that gendered participation and voting are significantly conditioned 
          by the party ideology. While economic insecurity tends to shift voting patterns 
          towards or away from governing parties in general, and its impact on female 
          candidate support would be worth looking into.</p>

        <h4>
          Dividing Power, Building Peace: The Impact of Political
          Decentralization on Conflict Resolution
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> -</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jhinuk Banerjee</p>
        <p>This study shows how political decentralization could 
          help mitigate conflicts across different democracies. Using comprehensive datasets, 
          this paper intends to employ an ordered logit analysis to investigate the relationship between 
          decentralization and the mitigation of various forms of conflicts. 
          This paper provides an understanding of how the power-sharing mechanism in different strata of governance influences
          conflict resolution.</p>
